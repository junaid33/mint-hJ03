When possible, we send custom documentation events in addition to the ones built-in to your analytics platform. For example, we send an event when a user opens or closes an [Accordion](../components/accordion).

## Enabling Analytics

Set your analytics keys in `mint.json`. You can add an unlimited number of analytics integrations for free.

The syntax for `mint.json` is below. You only need to include entries for the platforms you want to connect.
